- Inspect the results of `commons-fileupload` and `commons-codec` and
  check the correctness of those results. One class of bug that we
  already saw: in row 12 (commit: 7410e99) of commons-codec, there are
  impacted classes but no impacted methods. Why? Could it be because
  fields have changed? Also, some impacted classes column are non-zero
  even though changed classes column is zero. Why?

  - (Mahdi) inspect five non-zero rows in commons-codec where some
    classes are impacted at the class level; document your findings,
    including why you think classes/methods were rightly (or wrongly)
    included in the results, in paper/appendix.tex under "Mahdi's
    Inspections". Make sure that you can build the paper using `make`
    and that you can view the PDF.
  
  - (Moustafa) inspect five non-zero rows in commons-codec where some classes are
    impacted at the class level; document your findings, including why
    you think classes/methods were rightly (or wrongly) included in
    the results, in paper/appendix.tex under "Moustafaâ€™s
    Inspections". Make sure that you can build the paper using `make`
    and that you can view the PDF.
  
  - (Jiang Wu) inspect all the remaining non-zero rows that Mahdi or
    Moustafa did not check; document your findings, including why you
    think classes/methods were rightly (or wrongly) included in the
    results, in paper/appendix.tex under "Jiang's Inspections". Make
    sure that you can build the paper using `make` and that you can
    view the PDF.

- (Moustafa) Understand how does Yuki's code generates the
  method-level dependency graph. Summarize your findings
  paper/appendix.tex, under "How Method-Level Change-Impact Analysis
  Works".

- (Mahdi) Fix bug in the first commit of both projects: all methods
  should be considered as impacted but they are not.

- (Jiang Wu) Run Mahdi's script on at least 10 more projects and put
  all the tables (including those for commons-codec and
  commons-fileupload) in `paper/appendix.tex`, under "Method-
  vs. Class-Level Change Impact Analysis".

  - send Owolabi a DM for suggestions of what projects to try.
  
- (Mahdi) Integrate STARTS method-level analysis with emop
  (https://github.com/SoftEngResearch/emop).

  -- Fork emop, and create a branch so that you can make a PR later.

  -- Ask Owolabi for help if you get stuck

- (Moustafa) When Mahdi is done integrating method-level analysis into
  emop, write script to run emop with method-level analysis, compare
  emop^M (emop with method-level analysis) with emop^C (emop with
  class-level analysis), run that script on the same projects that
  used for change-impact analysis, and put the results in
  paper/appendix.tex, under "Method- vs. Class-Level eMOP Results".
